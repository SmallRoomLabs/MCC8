# MCC8

This is a small handheld PIC24-based CHIP-8 emulator game console. A cheap Noika 1202 LCD is used as the display and a CR123A 3 volt lithium battery for power. More info about the project can be found at [DangerousPrototypes.com](http://dangerousprototypes.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=56&t=6018)

The sixteen buttons on the right is a hexadecimal keypad arranged in the same strange order as the COSMAC had for maximum keyplacement compability. Then I've added four extra buttons to go into game selection menu mode and other stuffs for future use.
